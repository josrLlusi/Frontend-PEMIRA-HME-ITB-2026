This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
(Make sure you have a nodeJs, VSCode, and Git installed)
Open the file/folder on your VS Code and install the library:
```bash
npm install
```
Make sure the node_modules folder exist after installing.
Change the .env.example to .env.local
Change the token or url to your liking.
After that, Open your terminal.
Don't forget to change the directory to this project folder.
run this code on the terminal to create a database.db:
```bash
node src/scripts/setup-db.js
```
Make sure you got a completion message.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can install SQlite viewer extension on VSCode to check the database.db.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
